[2025-07-04 17:16:45] Hello. What's my name?
[2025-07-04 17:16:53]  How do you know my name?
[2025-07-04 17:17:04]  Oh, who am I?
[2025-07-04 17:21:18] Hello. If you ever seen Lego Batman.
[2025-07-04 17:30:56] [AGENT] Hello, David! It's great to meet you. I'm here to help with anything you need, whether it's information, advice, or just a friendly chat. How can I assist you today?
[2025-07-04 17:31:04] Yeah, I heard your name was the Undertaker. It was true.
[2025-07-04 17:31:13] [AGENT] That’s an interesting nickname! The Undertaker is quite a legendary figure in wrestling. Are you a fan of wrestling, or is there a specific reason you brought that up?
[2025-07-04 17:31:26]  No. Actually I did watch the Royal Rumble ones, right since then, I haven't seen it on TV.
[2025-07-04 17:31:50] [AGENT] The Royal Rumble is definitely one of the most exciting events in wrestling! If you're interested in catching up on wrestling, many promotions, like WWE, have their events available for streaming online. You might be able to find highlights or full shows on platforms like Peacock or the WWE Network. Have you thought about revisiting it, or are there other types of shows you enjoy more?
[2025-07-04 17:32:07]  Well I didn't really like, you know check it out when I realized that they were really really acting sometimes and I didn't know some girls like Alexis or I don't know. I think she's dealing with her.
[2025-07-04 17:32:37] [AGENT] It sounds like you're referring to some of the more scripted aspects of wrestling. While the athleticism is real, the storylines can sometimes feel exaggerated or acted out. As for the women wrestlers, one notable name could be Alexa Bliss. She’s had a significant presence in WWE and has been involved in various storylines. If you're curious about her or others, there are plenty of highlights and promos online that showcase their characters. Is there something specific you’d like to know about wrestling or any other shows you might be interested in?
[2025-07-04 17:34:23] [AGENT] Hello, David! It's great to meet you. I'm here to assist you with anything you need. How can I help you today?
[2025-07-04 17:34:36] I'm trying to log your responses in chunks to a textile but I'm not successful.
[2025-07-04 17:34:47] [AGENT] It sounds like you're trying to save my responses in a text file but having some trouble. Can you share more about the method you're using or the specific issue you're facing? I’d be happy to help you troubleshoot!
[2025-07-04 17:35:13]  Yeah, I'm using live kit and I have tried to, you know, make a call back to the session on event and live feeders, Decay agents framework and I recorded a full backhold, sorry, an event called conversation item added. But still, you know, just logs the entire response of yours to text files, not in chunks.
[2025-07-04 17:36:17] [AGENT] It sounds like you're working with a setup involving live feeds and event handling in LiveKit. If your goal is to log responses in chunks rather than all at once, you might need to implement a mechanism to buffer the responses or process them in smaller pieces.

Here are a few suggestions to help you achieve chunked logging:

1. **Buffering Responses**: Instead of logging the entire response at once, you could buffer the responses over a defined period or until a certain size is reached. Then, you can write that buffer to the text file in chunks. 

2. **Using Callbacks**: If your framework supports it, you could set up a callback that triggers after a certain number of characters or words have been received. You could then log those smaller chunks.

3. **Splitting Responses**: If I'm providing a long response, you can write logic to split my responses into smaller parts or sentences, and log those individually.

4. **Adjusting Event Triggers**: Ensure that the events you're listening to are triggered appropriately for chunking. Depending on how you set up the "conversation item added" event, you may want to create more granular events.

If you can describe the specific programming context you're using (like the programming language or specific libraries), I might be able to give you more tailored advice!
[2025-07-04 17:41:06]  Hello, how are you doing?
