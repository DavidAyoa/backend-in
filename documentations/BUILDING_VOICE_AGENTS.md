# Building voice agents

> In-depth guide to voice AI with LiveKit Agents.

## Overview

Building a great voice AI app requires careful orchestration of multiple components. LiveKit Agents is built on top of the [Realtime SDK](https://github.com/livekit/python-sdks) to provide dedicated abstractions that simplify development while giving you full control over the underlying code.

## Agent sessions

The `AgentSession` is the main orchestrator for your voice AI app. The session is responsible for collecting user input, managing the voice pipeline, invoking the LLM, and sending the output back to the user.

Each session requires at least one `Agent` to orchestrate. The agent is responsible for defining the core AI logic - instructions, tools, etc - of your app. The framework supports the design of custom [workflows](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/workflows.md) to orchestrate handoff and delegation between multiple agents.

The following example shows how to begin a simple single-agent session:

```python
from livekit.agents import AgentSession, Agent, RoomInputOptions
from livekit.plugins import openai, cartesia, deepgram, noise_cancellation, silero
from livekit.plugins.turn_detector.multilingual import MultilingualModel

session = AgentSession(
    stt=deepgram.STT(),
    llm=openai.LLM(),
    tts=cartesia.TTS(),
    vad=silero.VAD.load(),
    turn_detection=turn_detector.MultilingualModel(),
)

await session.start(
    room=ctx.room,
    agent=Agent(instructions="You are a helpful voice AI assistant."),
    room_input_options=RoomInputOptions(
        noise_cancellation=noise_cancellation.BVC(),
    ),
)

```

### RoomIO

Communication between agent and user participants happens using media streams, also known as tracks. For voice AI apps, this is primarily audio, but can include vision. By default, track management is handled by `RoomIO`, a utility class that serves as a bridge between the agent session and the LiveKit room. When an AgentSession is initiated, it automatically creates a `RoomIO` object that enables all room participants to subscribe to available audio tracks.

To learn more about publishing audio and video, see the following topics:

- **[Agent speech and audio](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/audio.md)**: Add speech, audio, and background audio to your agent.

- **[Vision](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/vision.md)**: Give your agent the ability to see images and live video.

- **[Text and transcription](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/text.md)**: Send and receive text messages and transcription to and from your agent.

- **[Realtime media](https://docs.livekit.io/home/client/tracks.md)**: Tracks are a core LiveKit concept. Learn more about publishing and subscribing to media.

- **[Camera and microphone](https://docs.livekit.io/home/client/tracks/publish.md)**: Use the LiveKit SDKs to publish audio and video tracks from your user's device.

#### Custom RoomIO

For greater control over media sharing in a room,  you can create a custom `RoomIO` object. For example, you might want to manually control which input and output devices are used, or to control which participants an agent listens to or responds to.

To replace the default one created in `AgentSession`, create a `RoomIO` object in your entrypoint function and pass it an instance of the `AgentSession` in the constructor. For examples, see the following in the GitHub repository:

- **[Toggling audio](https://github.com/livekit/agents/blob/main/examples/voice_agents/push_to_talk.py)**: Create a push-to-talk interface to toggle audio input and output.

- **[Toggling input and output](https://github.com/livekit/agents/blob/main/examples/voice_agents/toggle_io.py)**: Toggle both audio and text input and output.

## Voice AI providers

You can choose from a variety of providers for each part of the voice pipeline to fit your needs. The framework supports both high-performance STT-LLM-TTS pipelines and speech-to-speech models. In either case, it automatically manages interruptions, transcription forwarding, turn detection, and more.

You may add these components to the `AgentSession`, where they act as global defaults within the app, or to each individual `Agent` if needed.

- **[TTS](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/integrations/tts.md)**: Text-to-speech integrations

- **[STT](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/integrations/stt.md)**: Speech-to-text integrations

- **[LLM](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/integrations/llm.md)**: Language model integrations

- **[Multimodal](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/integrations/realtime.md)**: Realtime multimodal APIs

## Capabilities

The following guides, in addition to others in this section, cover the core capabilities of the `AgentSession` and how to leverage them in your app.

- **[Workflows](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/workflows.md)**: Orchestrate complex tasks among multiple agents.

- **[Tool definition & use](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/tools.md)**: Use tools to call external services, inject custom logic, and more.

- **[Pipeline nodes](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/nodes.md)**: Add custom behavior to any component of the voice pipeline.
