# Pipeline nodes and hooks

> Learn how to customize the behavior of your agent with nodes and hooks in the voice pipeline.

## Overview

You can fully customize your agent's behavior at multiple **nodes** in the processing path. A node is a point in the path where one process transitions to another. Some example customizations include:

- Use a custom STT, LLM, or TTS provider without a plugin.
- Generate a custom greeting when an agent enters a session.
- Modify STT output to remove filler words before sending it to the LLM.
- Modify LLM output before sending it to TTS to customize pronunciation.
- Update the user interface when an agent or user finishes speaking.

The `Agent` supports the following nodes and hooks. Some nodes are only available for STT-LLM-TTS pipeline models, and others are only available for realtime models.

Lifecycle hooks:

- `on_enter()`: Called after the agent becomes the active agent in a session.
- `on_exit()`: Called before the agent gives control to another agent in the same session.
- `on_user_turn_completed()`: Called when the user's [turn](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/turns.md) has ended, before the agent's reply.

STT-LLM-TTS pipeline nodes:

- `stt_node()`: Transcribe input audio to text.
- `llm_node()`: Perform inference and generate a new conversation turn (or tool call).
- `tts_node()`: Synthesize speech from the LLM text output.

Realtime model nodes:

- `realtime_audio_output_node()`: Adjust output audio before publishing to the user.

Transcription node:

- `transcription_node()`: Adjust pipeline or realtime model transcription before sending to the user.

The following diagrams show the processing path for STT-LLM-TTS pipeline models and realtime models.

## How to implement

Override the method within a custom `Agent` subclass to customize the behavior of your agent at a specific node in the processing path. To use the default, call `Agent.default.<node-name>()`. For instance, this code overrides the STT node while maintaining the default behavior.

```python
async def stt_node(self, audio: AsyncIterable[rtc.AudioFrame], model_settings: ModelSettings) -> Optional[AsyncIterable[stt.SpeechEvent]]:
    # insert custom before STT processing here
    events = Agent.default.stt_node(self, audio, model_settings)
    # insert custom after STT processing here
    return events

```

## Lifecycle hooks

The following lifecycle hooks are available for customization.

### On enter

The `on_enter` node is called when the agent becomes the active agent in a session. Each session can have only one active agent at a time, which can be read from the `session.agent` property. Change the active agent using [Workflows](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/workflows.md).

For example, to greet the user:

```python
async def on_enter(self):
    await self.session.generate_reply(
        instructions="Greet the user with a warm welcome",
    )

```

### On exit

The `on_exit` node is called before the agent gives control to another agent in the same session as part of a [workflow](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/workflows.md). Use it to save data, say goodbye, or perform other actions and cleanup.

For example, to say goodbye:

```python
async def on_exit(self):
    await self.session.generate_reply(
        instructions="Tell the user a friendly goodbye before you exit.",
    )

```

### On user turn completed

The `on_user_turn_completed` node is called when the user's [turn](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/turns.md) has ended, before the agent's reply. Override this method to modify the content of the turn, cancel the agent's reply, or perform other actions.

> ℹ️ **Realtime model turn detection**
> 
> To use the `on_user_turn_completed` node with a [realtime model](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/integrations/realtime.md), you must configure [turn detection](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/turns.md) to occur in your agent instead of within the realtime model.

The node receives the following parameters:

- `turn_ctx`: The full `ChatContext`, up to but not including the user's latest message.
- `new_message`: The user's latest message, representing their current turn.

After the node is complete, the `new_message` is added to the chat context.

One common use of this node is [retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/external-data.md). You can retrieve context relevant to the newest message and inject it into the chat context for the LLM.

```python
from livekit.agents import ChatContext, ChatMessage

async def on_user_turn_completed(
    self, turn_ctx: ChatContext, new_message: ChatMessage,
) -> None:
    rag_content = await my_rag_lookup(new_message.text_content())
    turn_ctx.add_message(
        role="assistant", 
        content=f"Additional information relevant to the user's next message: {rag_content}"
    )

```

Additional messages added in this way are not persisted beyond the current turn. To permanently add messages to the chat history, use the `update_chat_ctx` method:

```python
async def on_user_turn_completed(
    self, turn_ctx: ChatContext, new_message: ChatMessage,
) -> None:
    rag_content = await my_rag_lookup(new_message.text_content())
    turn_ctx.add_message(role="assistant", content=rag_content)
    await self.update_chat_ctx(turn_ctx)

```

You can also edit the `new_message` object to modify the user's message before it's added to the chat context. For example, you can remove offensive content or add additional context. These changes are persisted to the chat history going forward.

```python
async def on_user_turn_completed(
    self, turn_ctx: ChatContext, new_message: ChatMessage,
) -> None:
    new_message.content = ["... modified message ..."]

```

To abort generation entirely—for example, in a push-to-talk interface—you can do the following:

```python
async def on_user_turn_completed(
    self, turn_ctx: ChatContext, new_message: ChatMessage,
) -> None:
    if not new_message.text_content:
        # for example, raise StopResponse to stop the agent from generating a reply
        raise StopResponse()

```

For a complete example, see the [multi-user agent with push to talk example](https://github.com/livekit/agents/blob/main/examples/voice_agents/push_to_talk.py).

## STT-LLM-TTS pipeline nodes

The following nodes are available for STT-LLM-TTS pipeline models.

### STT node

The `stt_node` transcribes audio frames into speech events, converting user audio input into text for the LLM. By default, this node uses the Speech-To-Text (STT) capability from the current agent. If the STT implementation doesn't support streaming natively, a Voice Activity Detection (VAD) mechanism wraps the STT.

You can override this node to implement:

- Custom pre-processing of audio frames
- Additional buffering mechanisms
- Alternative STT strategies
- Post-processing of the transcribed text

To use the default implementation, call `Agent.default.stt_node()`.

This example adds a noise filtering step:

```python
from livekit import rtc
from livekit.agents import ModelSettings, stt, Agent
from typing import AsyncIterable, Optional

async def stt_node(
    self, audio: AsyncIterable[rtc.AudioFrame], model_settings: ModelSettings
) -> Optional[AsyncIterable[stt.SpeechEvent]]:
    async def filtered_audio():
        async for frame in audio:
            # insert custom audio preprocessing here
            yield frame
    
    async for event in Agent.default.stt_node(self, filtered_audio(), model_settings):
        # insert custom text postprocessing here 
        yield event

```

### LLM node

The `llm_node` is responsible for performing inference based on the current chat context and creating the agent's response or tool calls. It may yield plain text (as `str`) for straightforward text generation, or `llm.ChatChunk` objects that can include text and optional tool calls. `ChatChunk` is helpful for capturing more complex outputs such as function calls, usage statistics, or other metadata.

You can override this node to:

- Customize how the LLM is used
- Modify the chat context prior to inference
- Adjust how tool invocations and responses are handled
- Implement a custom LLM provider without a plugin

To use the default implementation, call `Agent.default.llm_node()`.

```python
from livekit.agents import ModelSettings, llm, FunctionTool, Agent
from typing import AsyncIterable

async def llm_node(
    self,
    chat_ctx: llm.ChatContext,
    tools: list[FunctionTool],
    model_settings: ModelSettings
) -> AsyncIterable[llm.ChatChunk]:
    # Insert custom preprocessing here
    async for chunk in Agent.default.llm_node(self, chat_ctx, tools, model_settings):
        # Insert custom postprocessing here
        yield chunk

```

### TTS node

The `tts_node` synthesizes audio from text segments, converting the LLM output into speech. By default, this node uses the Text-To-Speech capability from the agent. If the TTS implementation doesn't support streaming natively, it uses a sentence tokenizer to split text for incremental synthesis.

You can override this node to:

- Provide different text chunking behavior
- Implement a custom TTS engine
- [Add custom pronunciation rules](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/audio.md#pronunciation)
- [Adjust the volume of the audio output](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/audio.md#volume)
- Apply any other specialized audio processing

To use the default implementation, call `Agent.default.tts_node()`.

```python
from livekit import rtc
from livekit.agents import ModelSettings, Agent
from typing import AsyncIterable

async def tts_node(
    self, text: AsyncIterable[str], model_settings: ModelSettings
) -> AsyncIterable[rtc.AudioFrame]:
    # Insert custom text processing here
    async for frame in Agent.default.tts_node(self, text, model_settings):
        # Insert custom audio processing here
        yield frame

```

## Realtime model nodes

The following nodes are available for realtime models.

### Realtime audio output node

The `realtime_audio_output_node` is called when a realtime model outputs speech. This allows you to modify the audio output before it's sent to the user. For example, you can [adjust the volume of the audio output](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/audio.md#volume).

To use the default implementation, call `Agent.default.realtime_audio_output_node()`.

```python
from livekit.agents import ModelSettings, rtc, Agent
from typing import AsyncIterable

async def realtime_audio_output_node(
    self, audio: AsyncIterable[rtc.AudioFrame], model_settings: ModelSettings
) -> AsyncIterable[rtc.AudioFrame]:
    # Insert custom audio preprocessing here
    async for frame in Agent.default.realtime_audio_output_node(self, audio, model_settings):
        # Insert custom audio postprocessing here
        yield frame

```

## Transcription node

The `transcription_node` finalizes transcriptions from text segments. This node is part of the forwarding path for agent transcriptions and can be used to adjust or post-process text coming from an LLM (or any other source) into a final transcribed form.

By default, the node simply passes the transcription to the task that forwards it to the designated output. You can override this node to:

- Clean up formatting
- Fix punctuation
- Strip unwanted characters
- Perform any other text transformations

To use the default implementation, call `Agent.default.transcription_node()`.

```python
from livekit.agents import ModelSettings
from typing import AsyncIterable

async def transcription_node(self, text: AsyncIterable[str], model_settings: ModelSettings) -> AsyncIterable[str]: 
    async for delta in text:
        yield delta.replace("😘", "")

```
