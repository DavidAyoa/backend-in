# Agent Marketplace Implementation

This document describes the comprehensive agent marketplace implementation that enables users to create, share, clone, and discover voice agents.

## üéØ Overview

The Agent Marketplace extends the existing voice agent system with powerful social features:
- **Public/Private Agent Visibility** - Agents can be shared publicly or kept private
- **Agent Forking/Cloning** - Users can clone public agents and customize them
- **Search & Discovery** - Find agents by name, description, tags, or category
- **Trending Agents** - Discover popular agents based on clone count
- **Creator Attribution** - Original creators are credited when agents are cloned
- **Multi-conversation Support** - Each agent can handle multiple simultaneous conversations

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema Changes

### New Fields Added to `agents` Table:
```sql
-- Marketplace visibility
is_public BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE

-- Clone tracking
original_agent_id INTEGER REFERENCES agents(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
clone_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0

-- Organization & discovery
tags TEXT DEFAULT '[]'  -- JSON array of tags
category TEXT DEFAULT 'general'

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_agents_is_public ON agents(is_public)
CREATE INDEX idx_agents_category ON agents(category)
CREATE INDEX idx_agents_clone_count ON agents(clone_count)
CREATE INDEX idx_agents_original_id ON agents(original_agent_id)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è API Endpoints

### Core Agent Management (Enhanced)
- `POST /agents/` - Create agent (now supports marketplace fields)
- `PUT /agents/{agent_id}` - Update agent (now supports marketplace fields)
- `PUT /agents/{agent_id}/visibility` - Toggle public/private visibility

### Marketplace Discovery
- `GET /agents/marketplace/browse` - Browse public agents
- `GET /agents/marketplace/search` - Search agents by query
- `GET /agents/marketplace/trending` - Get trending agents
- `GET /agents/marketplace/stats` - Get marketplace statistics

### Agent Cloning
- `POST /agents/{agent_id}/clone` - Clone an agent
- `GET /agents/{agent_id}/clones` - View all clones of an agent

## üìä Features Implemented

### ‚úÖ Public/Private Agent Visibility
- Agents are private by default
- Owners can publish agents to the marketplace
- Only public agents appear in marketplace browsing
- Private agents remain accessible only to their owners

### ‚úÖ Agent Categorization & Tagging
- **Categories**: business, development, travel, testing, general, etc.
- **Tags**: JSON array of keywords for better discoverability
- **Filtering**: Browse by category, search by tags

### ‚úÖ Search & Filtering
- **Full-text search** across agent names, descriptions, and tags
- **Category filtering** to narrow results
- **Pagination** with limit/offset support
- **Sorting** by creation date (newest first)

### ‚úÖ Clone Tracking & Statistics
- **Clone count** automatically incremented when agents are cloned
- **Original agent tracking** - clones reference their source
- **Clone genealogy** - view all clones of an agent
- **Usage statistics** for marketplace analytics

### ‚úÖ Trending Agents
- **Popularity ranking** based on clone count
- **Recent activity** as secondary sort criteria
- **Configurable limits** for trending lists

### ‚úÖ Creator Attribution
- **Creator information** preserved in marketplace listings
- **Username and full name** displayed with agents
- **Credit tracking** when agents are cloned

### ‚úÖ Multi-conversation Support
- Each agent can handle **multiple simultaneous conversations**
- **Isolated session contexts** per conversation
- **WebSocket support** for real-time voice interactions
- **Session management** with cleanup and monitoring

## üîß Implementation Details

### Database Migration
- **Backward compatible** - existing agents continue to work
- **Automatic migration** script adds marketplace fields
- **Data preservation** - no existing data is lost
- **Index optimization** for marketplace queries

### Security & Permissions
- **Owner-only modifications** - only agent owners can edit their agents
- **Public cloning** - any user can clone public agents
- **Private protection** - private agents invisible to others
- **User limits** - respects existing agent creation limits

### Performance Optimization
- **Database indexes** on marketplace fields
- **Efficient queries** with proper JOIN operations
- **Pagination** to handle large result sets
- **Caching-ready** structure for future enhancements

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### 1. Create & Publish Agent
```bash
# Create agent
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/agents/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agent_name": "Customer Service Bot",
    "description": "Helpful customer service assistant",
    "system_prompt": "You are a customer service representative"
  }'

# Publish to marketplace
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8000/agents/1/visibility?is_public=true \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### 2. Browse Marketplace
```bash
# Browse all public agents
curl http://localhost:8000/agents/marketplace/browse

# Browse by category
curl http://localhost:8000/agents/marketplace/browse?category=business

# Paginate results
curl http://localhost:8000/agents/marketplace/browse?limit=10&offset=20
```

### 3. Search Agents
```bash
# Search by keyword
curl http://localhost:8000/agents/marketplace/search?q=customer

# Search with category filter
curl http://localhost:8000/agents/marketplace/search?q=coding&category=development
```

### 4. Clone Agent
```bash
# Clone with custom name
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/agents/1/clone \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "new_name": "My Customer Service Bot"
  }'
```

### 5. Use Cloned Agent in Voice Conversation
```bash
# WebSocket connection with cloned agent
ws://localhost:8000/ws/auth?token=YOUR_TOKEN&agent_id=CLONED_AGENT_ID
```

## üìà Marketplace Statistics

The system tracks comprehensive marketplace metrics:

```json
{
  "total_public_agents": 25,
  "total_clones": 147,
  "total_categories": 8,
  "total_creators": 12,
  "categories": [
    {"category": "business", "count": 8},
    {"category": "development", "count": 6},
    {"category": "travel", "count": 4},
    {"category": "education", "count": 3}
  ]
}
```

## üîÑ Agent Lifecycle

## üéâ Conclusion

The Agent Marketplace transforms the voice agent system from a personal tool into a collaborative platform where users can:
- **Share knowledge** through public agents
- **Learn from others** by cloning and studying popular agents
- **Build communities** around specific use cases and categories
- **Accelerate development** by starting with proven agent templates
- **Scale conversations** with multi-session support

This implementation provides a solid foundation for a thriving agent ecosystem while maintaining the robust voice processing capabilities that make the system unique.
